# Open-source connector registry

Use this reference before choosing any GitHub project for Reddit, X, YouTube, Amazon, JD, Taobao/Tmall, or Kickstarter research. The machine-readable registry is [open-source-connectors.json](../assets/open-source-connectors.json).

The registry covers acquisition code, not research conclusions. A repository may be open source while its acquisition method is disallowed, its output is stale, or its data cannot be reused for the intended study.

## Four gates, in order

| Gate | Question | Pass condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code | Can we inspect, fork, and redistribute the code? | Recognized license, pinned revision, understandable dependencies |
| Access | Does the project use a permitted platform surface? | Official API or another explicitly authorized route; no login simulation, internal endpoint, CAPTCHA bypass, or rate-limit bypass |
| Data | May this study retain and use the returned data? | Platform terms, dataset terms, privacy, deletion, and redistribution rules reviewed for this use |
| Research | Can the output support the intended claim? | Required fields, source hierarchy, time range, counter-evidence, and concentration controls are available |

Failure at an earlier gate ends the review. Do not compensate for a failed access gate with a stronger parser or a permissive code license.

## Reviewed projects as of 2026-08-27

| Platform | Repository | Registry decision | What it means for SURE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reddit | [praw-dev/praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw) | `supported` | Default OSS client when the study has approved Reddit Data API access; register the API app by 2026-09-30 and re-review after the Devvit transition |
| X | [tweepy/tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) | `supported` | Default OSS client for the official X API |
| YouTube | [googleapis/google-api-python-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client) | `supported` | Default OSS client for YouTube Data API search, metadata, and comment threads |
| Amazon | [hyp1231/AmazonReviews2023](https://github.com/hyp1231/AmazonReviews2023) | `historical_only` | Historical review analysis through September 2023; no current live signal |
| Amazon | [ae9is/amazon-reviews](https://github.com/ae9is/amazon-reviews) | `historical_only` | Self-hosted GraphQL layer over the same historical dataset; AGPL review required |
| X | [JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape) | `blocked` | Non-API scraper; incompatible with current X guidance and stale for current X behavior |
| X | [d60/twikit](https://github.com/d60/twikit) | `blocked` | Uses an internal API without an official API key; maintained code does not make the route permitted |
| YouTube | [egbertbouman/youtube-comment-downloader](https://github.com/egbertbouman/youtube-comment-downloader) | `blocked` | Comment scraping without the YouTube Data API; current YouTube policy prohibits scraped YouTube data |
| YouTube | [jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api) | `blocked` | Useful codebase, but the retrieval route is outside the official Data API and is not a SURE default |
| JD | [2274900/JD_comment_spider](https://github.com/2274900/JD_comment_spider) | `blocked` | Old direct-endpoint scraper, not a maintained or policy-compatible current connector |
| Taobao/Tmall | [l010306/taobao-review-playwright](https://github.com/l010306/taobao-review-playwright) | `blocked` | Automates QR login and saves session state; current platform rules prohibit unauthorized crawling and simulated use |
| Kickstarter | [ImWhiteRabbit/KSInsights](https://github.com/ImWhiteRabbit/KSInsights) | `blocked` | Historical snapshots exist, but the feed stopped in 2025 and was produced by a crawler that conflicts with current Kickstarter terms |

`blocked` does not mean the code is poor. It means this project cannot be selected as a SURE acquisition connector under the reviewed conditions. Keeping negative reviews in the registry prevents another Agent from rediscovering the repository and treating GitHub availability as permission.

## Current platform conclusion

### Stable default routes

- Reddit: PRAW on approved Reddit Data API access.
- X: Tweepy on the official X API.
- YouTube: Google's Python API client on the YouTube Data API.

These clients solve transport and object handling. They do not solve route design, representativeness, retention, deletion, or evidence coding.

Reddit's 2026 [public Data API plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/1vgbm9c/our_plans_for_the_future_of_reddits_public_data/) keeps PRAW valid for studies that already hold approved access, but existing apps must be registered by 2026-09-30, new self-service access is closed pending approval, and the long-term direction is the Developer Platform (Devvit). A study without approved Reddit credentials records a Reddit access gap; it does not downgrade to a blocked non-API route. Re-review the Reddit entry after 2026-09-30.

### Historical route

Amazon Reviews 2023 is useful for developing parsers, codebooks, variant-aware sampling, and historical category hypotheses. It ends in September 2023. Use `source_period_end=2023-09`, label every conclusion historical, and confirm the dataset reuse basis separately from the GitHub code license.

### No supported live OSS connector found

At this review date, the registry has no supported live third-party connector for Amazon reviews, JD reviews, Taobao/Tmall reviews, or Kickstarter. For these platforms:

1. do not silently switch to a seller API, commercial provider, login session, internal endpoint, or browser automation;
2. record the route as blocked;
3. use a lawful historical dataset when one passes the data-rights gate;
4. use small manual public examples only as discovery material where permitted, not as a disguised bulk collector;
5. move validation to interviews, user-supplied records, field observation, or another authorized source family.

This negative result is part of the method. A platform is not an available evidence source merely because a GitHub search returns a scraper.

## CLI usage

List selectable connectors:

```bash
python3 scripts/sure.py connectors
python3 scripts/sure.py connectors --platform amazon
```

Include rejected projects and their reasons:

```bash
python3 scripts/sure.py connectors --platform x --include-blocked
```

When a platform adapter is enabled, `sure.py check` verifies that:

- `connector_id` exists in the bundled registry;
- the connector belongs to the selected platform;
- the pinned revision and code license match the reviewed entry;
- the connector is not blocked;
- historical-only connectors use `access_basis=historical_dataset`;
- platform terms and dataset rights were reviewed for this study.

## Forking or adding a connector

Do not overwrite an existing registry entry with a fork. Add a new entry with a new ID and complete this review:

1. pin a commit, not a floating branch;
2. record the SPDX code license and all dependency licenses that affect redistribution;
3. describe the actual acquisition mechanism by reading the code;
4. search for login automation, saved cookies, internal endpoints, proxy rotation, CAPTCHA handling, and 403/429 bypass;
5. review the current platform terms and the intended study use;
6. review dataset/content rights separately from the code license;
7. map output to the [connector contract](connector-contract.md);
8. run a small fixture test and a blocked-route test;
9. set `decision=supported` or `historical_only` only when all earlier gates pass;
10. preserve the negative review if it remains blocked.

Never copy GPL/AGPL code into the MIT SURE codebase without a license-compatible plan. A separate process or service boundary may still carry obligations and needs review.
